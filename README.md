# Wine Quality Prediction

![GitHub](https://github.com/Akhilesh2921/CodeClauseInternship_WineQualityPrediction)

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for predicting the quality of red wine based on its chemical attributes using a Random Forest Regressor. The dataset used for this project is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
